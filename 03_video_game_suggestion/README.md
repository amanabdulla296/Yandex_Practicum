You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017.

The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB: The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.


Following steps will conducted to complete the task:

**Import and Preprocessing data**
- open the datafile
- deal with column names, missing values, data types (with appropariate reason how you deal with them).
- calcualte the total sales (the sum of sales in all regions) for each game

**Analyze the data**
- How many games were released in different years?
- How sales varied from platform to platform. How long does it generally take for new platforms to appear and old ones to fade?
- Determine what period you should take data for. To do so, look at your answers to the previous questions. The data should allow you to build a prognosis for 2017. Work only with the data that you've decided is relevant. Disregard the data for previous years.
- Which platforms are leading in sales? Which ones are growing or shrinking?
- How global sales of all games broken down by platform? Are the differences in sales significant? What about average sales on various platforms?
- How user and professional reviews affect sales for one popular platform (you choose)?
- What can we say about the most profitable genres? Can you generalize about genres with high and low sales?

**Create a user profile for regions:NA, EU, JP)**

- The top five platforms. Describe variations in their market shares from region to region.
- The top five genres. Explain the difference.
- Do ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions?

**Test the hypotheses**
- Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
- Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
    - How you formulated the null and alternative hypotheses?
    - What significance level you chose to test the hypotheses, and why?
