A portfolio of up to 15 projects. The team will help you polish up each of your projects so that your portfolio stands out to employers.

Practicum is open to students of all experience levels; the only requirement is a high school diploma. The programs range in price between $3,000 and $5,000. The first 20 hours of each program are free.
