In this project, as an data analyst for the telecom operator Megaline, we will find out a plan that brings in more revenue. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget.

We are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. We will have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Our job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

## Table of Contents:
- **Open the data file and have a look at the general information**
- **Data preprocessing**
- **For each user, find following:**
  - The number of calls made and minutes used per month
  - The number of text messages sent per month
  - The volume of data per month
  - The monthly revenue from each user (subtract the free package limit from the total number of calls, text messages, and data; multiply the result by the calling plan value; add the monthly charge depending on the calling plan)

- **Analyze the data:**
  - Describe the customers' behavior. Find the minutes, texts, and volume of data the users of each plan require per month. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation. -   - Plot histograms. Describe the distributions.

- **Test the hypotheses:**
  - The average revenue from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs.
  - The average revenue from users in NY-NJ area is different from that of the users from other regions.
