Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones.
IN this project, our task is to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. The data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank has been provided.

We will analyze the provided data, try to build model with highest possible F1 score (minimum requiored F1 is 0.59). 

## Table of Contents:
- **Load/Preprocess and Explore data;
- **Build model with raw (class imbalance) data;
- **Fix the class imbalance and improve the quality of the model;
- **Final testing of the tuned model.

Each and every step will contain a preliminary conclusion about the finding/outcomes of the performed tasks. For the tuned model in the last step, the AUC-ROC metric will be compared with the F1 score.
