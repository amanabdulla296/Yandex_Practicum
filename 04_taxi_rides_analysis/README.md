In this project, as a data analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago, our task is to find patterns in the available information. We want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Prior to that, we have conducted data extraction from SQL databases and several data analysis tasks on a separate platform. Now we have been provided with two datasets from previous SQL tasks.

## Table of Contents:
- **Load and Check data**
- **EDA**
- **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Summary**


## Dataset Description:
 - ```project_sql_result_01.csv``` => which contains name and number of rides made by each company on November 15-16, 2017
 - ```project_sql_result_04.csv``` => which contains name of neighborhood where a ride ended and average number of rides ended in each neighborhood
 - ```project_sql_result_07.csv``` => which contains starting time of ride, weather condition at the start and duration of ride.
